--- Step 1: Loading and Preparing Final Analysis Dataset ---
All data files loaded successfully.
Successfully created final dataset for modeling.

--- Step 2: Preparing data for machine learning model ---
Created dummy variables. The model will use 116 features.
Split data into 70% for training and 30% for testing.

--- Step 4: Training the Random Forest Classifier ---
Model training complete.

--- Step 5: Model Predictive Accuracy on test data: 88.69% ---

--- Step 6: Identifying Most Important Variables ---

Passing `palette` without assigning `hue` is deprecated and will be removed in v0.14.0. Assign the `y` variable to `hue` and set `legend=False` for the same effect.
